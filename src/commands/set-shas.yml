  Derives SHAs for base and head for use in `nx affected` commands in CI

parameters:
  main-branch-name:
    type: string
    default: "main"
    description: |
      The name of the main branch in your repo, used as the target of PRs. E.g. main, master etc.
  error-on-no-successful-workflow:
    type: boolean
    default: false
    description: |
      By default, if no successful workflow is found on the main branch to determine the SHA,
      we will log a warning and use HEAD~1. Enable this option to error and exit instead.
steps:
  - run:
      environment:
        PARAM_MAIN_BRANCH: <<parameters.main-branch-name>>
        PARAM_ERROR_ON_NO_SUCCESSFUL_WORKFLOW: <<parameters.error-on-no-successful-workflow>>
      name: Derives SHAs for base and head for use in `nx affected` commands
      shell: "/bin/bash"
      command: |
        RESPONSE=$(node <<include(scripts/find-successful-workflow.js)>> $CIRCLE_BUILD_URL $CIRCLE_BRANCH $PARAM_MAIN_BRANCH $PARAM_ERROR_ON_NO_SUCCESSFUL_WORKFLOW)
        echo "$RESPONSE"
        BASE_SHA=$(echo $RESPONSE | grep 'Commit:' text.txt | sed 's/.*Commit: //')
        HEAD_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
        echo "Base SHA"
        echo $NX_BASE
        echo ""
        echo "Head SHA"
        echo $NX_HEAD
        echo ""
        echo "export NX_BASE=\"$BASE_SHA\";" >> $BASH_ENV
        echo "export NX_HEAD=\"$HEAD_SHA\";" >> $BASH_ENV
        echo ""
        echo "NX_BASE and NX_HEAD environment variables have been set for the current Job"
