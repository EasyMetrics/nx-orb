  You need to specify `main-branch-name` if different than `main`.
  If last successful workflow run was not found, by default we report warning and fallback to HEAD~1.
  You can instead make this a hard error by settting 'error-on-no-successful-workflow' to true.
usage:
  version: 2.1
  orbs:
    nx: nrwl/nx@1.0.0
  jobs:
    build:
      docker:
        - image: cimg/node:14.17-browsers
      steps:
        - checkout
        - run:
            name: Install dependencies
            command: yarn install --frozen-lockfile
        - nx/set-shas:
            main-branch-name: "master"
            error-on-no-successful-workflow: true
        - run:
            name: Run Builds
            command: yarn nx affected --target=build --base=$NX_BASE
        - run:
            name: Run Unit Tests
            command: yarn nx affected --target=test --base=$NX_BASE
